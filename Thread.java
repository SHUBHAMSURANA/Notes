// Differet ways to handle race condition in thread
1. Using Synchronized Blocks
2. Using Reentrant Locks
3. Using Atomic Variables
4. Using Concurrent Collections
        private ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
5. Using volatile Keyword

 ******Volatile******
 Visibility: volatile ensures that changes to a variable are visible to all threads
 Without volatile, threads might cache variables value from thread cache, but using volatile the value will be picked from RAM [Ram will have the updated value] and it will be shared same value across all the threads. 

public class VolatileExample {
    private volatile boolean flag = false;
    public void writer() {
        flag = true; // Writes to the volatile variable
    }

    public void reader() {
        while (!flag) {
            // Wait until the flag becomes true
            // Infinite loop will not run and we will save it
        }
        System.out.println("Flag is true!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        VolatileExample example = new VolatileExample();

        // Creating the thread without run method
        Thread writerThread = new Thread(example::writer);
        Thread readerThread = new Thread(example::reader);
        
        readerThread.start();
        writerThread.start();
    }
}

Output: 
Flag is true!
*****Atomic*******
The use of Atomic classes is crucial in scenarios where you need to perform atomic operations on variables shared between multiple threads, ensuring data consistency without using explicit synchronization mechanisms like synchronized blocks or Locks. 
// AtomicInteger/AtomicLong/AtomicBoolean/AtomicReference<V>{Provides atomic operations on reference objects (like any custom object or non-primitive data types).}
public class AtomicCounterExample {
    private AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);

    public void increment() {
        count.incrementAndGet(); // Atomic increment
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count.get();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        AtomicCounterExample counter = new AtomicCounterExample();

        // Two threads incrementing the count
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();

        System.out.println("Final count: " + counter.getCount());  // This will always be 2000
    }
}

Purpose of Thread Priorities
Thread Scheduling: The priority of a thread is a hint to the JVM about how to prioritize the thread relative to other threads. A higher-priority thread may be given more CPU time than a lower-priority thread. However, the actual scheduling depends on the JVM and OSâ€™s thread scheduling policies.
Prioritization: Setting priorities allows developers to influence the order in which threads are executed. For example, you might set a higher priority for a thread that performs critical tasks and a lower priority for background tasks.

highPriorityThread.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
lowPriorityThread.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);

Thread.Interrupted;
[when it is called, thread will stop its procees if its in sleep or running and exception will be thrown which need to be handle by catch]

public class InterruptExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread worker = new Thread(() -> {
            try {

                    // Simulate work
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                    System.out.println("Working...");
                }

Key learning
Interrupting the First Thread: The first thread is interrupted while it is sleeping, causing it to exit early. It only runs for 2 iterations before being interrupted.
Creating a New Thread: After the first thread finishes, the main thread creates a new thread and starts it. The new thread runs for 5 full iterations without interruption.

**************************
Thread.yield()
It will ask scheduler that , please now give chance to other thread, if two threads are running that each thraed will run periodically.

Daemon Thread: A daemon thread is a thread that runs in the background, When all non-daemon threads (user threads) have finished, the JVM will terminate, even if there are still daemon threads running.

background services such as logging, monitoring, or periodic maintenance tasks
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) uses daemon threads for garbage collection.
Tasks that need to be executed periodically but do not affect the main application flow

example::method1 is a method reference that is equivalent to a lambda expression () -> example.method1().
example::method1 matches the Runnable interface because method1 has no parameters and returns void, fitting the run method signature in the Runnable interface.
