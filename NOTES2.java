Agile methodilogy:
WaterFall method : where front end and back end everything are in one system and refer as monolithic application.
					Single point of failure, downtime when we have deploymnet.
The Waterfall model is a sequential software development process model.

Requirements Gathering-> System Design-> Implementation->Testing->Deployment->Maintenance

Agile : Rapid development and rapid deploymnet [everything is split into multiple sevrices, no Single point of failure]
Everything is break up into task, an individual can pick and work on it.
